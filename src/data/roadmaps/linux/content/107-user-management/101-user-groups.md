# User Management: Users & Groups

User management in Linux uses user groups to manage system users and permissions efficiently. A user group is a collection of users that simplifies system administration by determining access rights to resources like files and directories. Each user belongs to one or more groups, allowing administrators to grant specific privileges without full superuser access. Commands like `groupadd`, `groupdel`, `groupmod`, `usermod`, and `gpasswd` are used to manage groups. Proper group management is crucial for a secure and organized system environment. For detailed instructions, refer to resources on managing Linux groups.

# User Management: Create, Update, and Delete Users

User management in Linux involves creating, updating, and deleting user accounts to ensure system security and efficient resource utilization. Administrators can create new users using commands like `useradd` or `adduser`, update user details such as home directory or login shell with `usermod`, and delete users using `userdel`. Effective user management leverages Linux's multi-user capabilities, maintaining a secure and organized system environment.

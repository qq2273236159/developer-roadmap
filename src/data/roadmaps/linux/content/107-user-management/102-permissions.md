# User Management: Managing Permissions

User management in Linux involves managing permissions to control who can access, modify, and execute files and directories. Permissions are categorized into read, write, and execute types and can be set for the file owner (user), the owning group, and others. Commands like `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` are used to view and manipulate these permissions. Properly managing permissions is crucial for maintaining system security and organization.

# SSR Frameworks

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique for rendering a JavaScript application on the server, rather than in the browser. This can improve the performance and user experience of a web application, as the initial render of the application is done on the server and the content is sent to the browser as a fully-rendered HTML page.

There are several frameworks and libraries available for server-side rendering React applications, most common being:

## Next.JS

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
